# The Game of Hidden Treasure
Hidden Treasure is a simple logic game, where the aim is to find the treasure by revealing clues.
The game begins with a grid of empty squares, and tells the user to click New Game to begin.
After New Game has been clicked on, the program will hide the treasure in a random square (not visible to the user), and randomly choose which player goes first.
When the player clicks on a square, the square is highlighted in the colour of that player (here, Player 1 = blue, Player 2 = yellow) and a value is revealed. The value shows the number of steps (up, down, left or right, but not diagonal), from that square to the hidden treasure.
The other player then takes their turn.
Play continues in turns. Players cannot select a square that's already been chosen.
When a player clicks on the square containing the hidden treasure ("X"), the game ends and that player is declared the winner.
The user can either click on New Game, where the treasure will be hidden in a new random location, or click on the close window button to close the application.
